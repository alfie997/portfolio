    <div>Hi, I'm Alfie.
    I build simple and clean frontend websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
    I'm available for small freelance jobs â€” paid in crypto (USDT, TRC20, or others).</div>
    <div>I'm a self-taught web developer. I work in challenging conditions, often with limited internet, but I've never stopped learning and building.
    I'm actively looking for work I can do remotely, and I care deeply about making clean, working websites.</div>
